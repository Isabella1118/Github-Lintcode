Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:

Input: 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

# Thinking: Cannot transfer numbers to strings, then considering create a reverse number to compare with the original one
# Similar to Q7 Reverse Integer

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x):
        """
        :type x: int
        :rtype: bool
        """
        if x < 0:
            return False
        
        tmp = x
        rev = 0
        while tmp:
            rev = rev * 10 + tmp % 10
            tmp //= 10
        return rev == x        # Judeging whetehr the reverse one equals the original one
