Two Sum - Closest to target

Given an array nums of n integers, find two integers in nums such that the sum is closest to a given number, target.
Return the difference between the sum of the two integers and the target.

Example
Given array nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], and target = 4.
The minimum difference is 1. (4 - (2 + 1) = 1).

class Solution:
    """
    @param nums: an integer array
    @param target: An integer
    @return: the difference between the sum and the target
