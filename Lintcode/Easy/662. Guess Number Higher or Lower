Description
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number is higher or lower.

You call a pre-defined API guess(int num) which returns 3 possible results (-1, 1, or 0):
 
Example
n = 10, I pick 4 (but you don't know)

Return 4. Correct !

Thinking: Binary Search

Solution:

"""
The guess API is already defined for you.
@param num, your guess
@return -1 if my number is lower, 1 if my number is higher, otherwise return 0
you can call Guess.guess(num)
"""


class Solution:
    # @param {int} n an integer
    # @return {int} the number you guess
    def guessNumber(self, n):
        # Write your code here
        left, right = 1, n   #注意这里是1到n
        while left <= right:  #注意这里是小于等于
            mid = int((left + right) / 2)   #注意这里要有int()
            if Guess.guess(mid) == -1:  # my number is lower than your guess
                right = mid - 1
            elif Guess.guess(mid) == 1:  # my number is higher than your guess
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                return mid
